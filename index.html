        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Alzheimer's Disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline 
            and changes in brain structure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers a non-invasive method to visualize structural 
            alterations in the brain associated with AD. The OASIS dataset provides a comprehensive collection of MRI scans, 
            including both longitudinal and cross-sectional data, from individuals with varying degrees of cognitive impairment. 
            This project aims to analyze both longitudinal AND cross-sectional MRI data from the OASIS dataset to uncover 
            patterns of brain atrophy associated with AD progression and identify potential other social, environmental, or 
            epigenetic factors for early diagnosis and intervention.

        <p> 
            First an introduction to the data: OASIS dataset comprises MRI scans from about 1240 subjects aged 18-96, both 
            nondemented and demented older adults. The longitudinal data includes subjects scanned on two or more visits,
            while the cross-sectional data includes subjects scanned at a single time point.
            This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between age and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores across 
            both longitudinal and cross-sectional datasets. The x-axis represents age, while the y-axis represents MMSE scores, 
            a measure of cognitive function. The blue dots indicate the overall distribution of age and MMSE scores in the combined dataset, 
            encompassing both longitudinal and cross-sectional data. This visualization aims to explore any potential trends or 
            patterns between age and cognitive function, providing insight into how cognitive performance may vary with age 
            across the entire dataset, and representing the demographics of the dataset as well.

            <p>
                Visualizing the age distribution provides insights into the demographics of the dataset and how age relates 
                to other variables. The age distribution of the OASIS dataset shows a wide range of ages, with the majority of individuals 
                between 60 and 80 years old. This distribution reflects the typical age range for Alzheimer's disease 
                diagnosis, which is most common in older adults. The dataset includes individuals with varying degrees of 
                cognitive impairment, from normal aging to severe dementia, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of brain 
                changes associated with AD progression. The mean and standard deviations are also displayed, with a mean of around 
                77 years old, which checks out with prior knowledge about Alzheimer's disease.

            <p>
                This boxplot displays MMSE (cognitive assessment) scores by dementia status, displayed in boxplot form. 
                Nondemented subjects have no symptoms of dementia, demented subjects do have symptoms, and converted 
                subjects developed symptoms over the course of data collection. The boxplot shows that nondemented subjects have
                higher average cognitive assesment scores than demented subjects, demonstrating how MMSE scores can be used to
                assess and seperate the patient groups within the data.

            <p>
                This is another histogram of age distribution, but this time there are bell curves and different shadings by
                CDR, or Clinical Dementia Rating. CDR is a scale used to assess the severity of dementia, with 0 = no impairment, 
                0.5 = questionable, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe dementia. The histogram demonstrates that most of
                the subjects in the dataset are of moderate or mild dementia diagnosis. There is no severe dementia patients
                because the dataset is cross-sectional, and severe dementia patients would not be able to participate in the study.
                It also shows that the majority of the more severe cases are in the older age group, which further clarifies the 
                demographic of the dataset and higher prevelance of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in older adults.

            <p>
                This is an interactive scatter plot built using Altair that visualizes the relationship between normalized whole 
                brain volume (nWBV) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. The x-axis represents nWBV, a measure of 
                brain volume, while the y-axis represents MMSE scores, a measure of cognitive function. The scatter plot includes 
                a trend line that shows the relationship between nWBV and MMSE scores, indicating that higher nWBV values are 
                associated with higher MMSE scores. This visualization allows us to explore the relationship between brain 
                volume and cognitive function and identify patterns or trends in the data. The points are shaded by socioeconomic
                status, on a scale of 1-5. All data points, when hovered over, show the nWBV, MMSE, and SSE.

                This is an interactive heatmap that compares brain structures across different diagnostic groups, specifically
                Estimated Total Intracranial Volume (eTIV) in Nondemented, Demented, and Converted patients. If a quadrant
                is hovered over, the participant ID, eTIV, and diagnostic group are displayed. The heatmap demonstrates that a 
                smaller eTIV is associated with a higher likelihood of dementia diagnosis, indicating that brain atrophy may be
                a key factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The heatmap also shows the distribution of eTIV values
                across different diagnostic groups, providing insights into the differences in brain structure between nondemented
                and demented patients.

            <p>
                This second interactive heatmap displays socieconomic score (SES) across the different diagnostic groups, while 
                hovering over a quadrant reveals the diagnostic group, SES, average age, education, and gender. The heatmap shows
                a higher SES is associated with a lower likelihood of dementia diagnosis, indicating that socioeconomic factors
                may play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The heatmap also provides insights into the distribution
                of SES values across different diagnostic groups, highlighting the differences in socioeconomic status between
                nondemented and demented patients.

    <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        Brain Size: Higher eTIV and nWBV seem to indicate higher MMSE score which indicates brain shrinkage in specific areas is correlated with cognitive decline.

        Socioeconomics and Education: While AD is influenced by gene, lower SES and education could correlate to dementia diagnosis due to environmental, upbringing, and epigenetics factors.

        Age: The stark spike in cases of dementia past the 70 mark confirms the demographic, and can give timelines when 
        searching for indications of AD.

        Significance: Due diligence of examining these specific brain atrophies and how they develop quantitatively and visually, 
        especially in those who are at higher risk of AD through these social, economic, and/or age factors, could help spur early 
        diagnosis, which is absolutely crucial and combatting AD and maintaining quality of life for patients and their families.
